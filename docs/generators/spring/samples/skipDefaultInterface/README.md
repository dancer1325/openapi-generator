# OpenAPI generated server

Spring Boot Server

## Overview
* `openapi-generator generate -g spring -o skipDefaultInterface -i https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openapitools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/3_0/petstore.yaml --additional-properties=skipDefaultInterface=true`
  * way to generate this project
  * Problems
    * Problem1: No 'openapi-generator-maven-plugin' was added
      * Attempt1: Check '../skipDefaultInterfaceAttemptTwo'
      * Reason: Own OpenAPI Generator is used rather than via Maven or Gradle plugin
    * Problem2: `skipDefaultInterface` was NOT included -- Obviously if plugin NOT added --
      * Solution: TODO: Why? How to do it?
* This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org), you can easily generate a server stub.
This is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.


The underlying library integrating OpenAPI to Spring Boot is [springdoc](https://springdoc.org).
Springdoc will generate an OpenAPI v3 specification based on the generated Controller and Model classes.
The specification is available to download using the following url:
http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs/

Start your server as a simple java application

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

Change default port value in application.properties
